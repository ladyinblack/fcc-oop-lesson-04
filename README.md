### [Make Code More Reusable with the this Keyword](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/object-oriented-programming/make-code-more-reusable-with-the-this-keyword)

## PROBLEM EXPLANATION
This challenge is simply demonstrating the power of the `this` keyword.  Replacing `this` keyword.  Replacing `dog.numLegs` with `this.numLegs` strengthens our code by directly referencing this object.
[developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) has many examples to determine the effects of the `this` keyword.
